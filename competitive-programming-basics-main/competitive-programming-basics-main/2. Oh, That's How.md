# Problems
Look around you. What do you see? I see problems... Many problems. Easy problems. Hard problems. A problem is a task that is needed to be solved. Similarly, in the programming world, we have problems. A programming problem is something like "Hey, so you have 2 numbers 6 and 9, you have to find out the sum of these numbers." Some harder problems can be like "Yo! So I want to build the GTA game! So how to write code for that?".

We will solve these problems by using code. And to write code, we need programming languages. In this course, we will mainly use C++ to learn how to code.

# Statements and Syntax
Just like normal languages, programming languages also have statements. These are individual complete thoughts like "I like you", "You are gross" or anything meaningful like that. Notice that you can also change the meaning by using different words. You can change "I like X" to "I like Y" which will change its meaning but you can't use "I like make" which doesn't make sense. So as you can see that every language must have rules or what we call grammars. C++ also has grammars which is called `Syntax`.

For example, in C++, `c = a + b;` is a statement. It means we have assigned the sum of two numbers `a` and `b` to `c`. But what are these `a`, `b`, `c`s anyways? Hmmzzz...

# Variables
Let's say to we need to find the sum of two numbers. But the thing is we need to store those numbers somewhere in the computer memory, right? Yes! Variables will do that for you. In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). For example,
```bash
int a = 6;
```

It means we are storing the number `6` into the variable `a`. What it will do is it will store the number `6` somewhere in the memory and whenever we will call `a`, it will look up for that memory and will see whats in there and it will find that there is `6`! So if we call `a` it will give use `6`. Pretty nice!

We can imagine this as buckets of numbers. Let's say there are 100 buckets. And we can store some numbers inside each bucket. To easily refer to some buckets, we can give each bucket a name. Let's call the 2nd bucket `newton` and 5th bucket `einstein`. Let's say `newton` has the number `6` and `einstein` has `9`. Now, let's call the 8th bucket `sum`. So we can just say `sum = newton + einstein` and then we know `newton` has `6` and `einstein` has `9`, so `sum = 6 + 9 = 15`, so there will be `15` in `sum`.

Similarly, we can see these buckets as memory addresses in RAM, and `newton`, `einstein`, and `sum` are called variables. Each variable is stored in `unique` memory addresses and the statement `sum = newton + einstein;` will assign `15` to the variable `sum`.

**Things to Notice:** Each variable name should be distinct. If we name both of the 2nd and 12th buckets newton, then if we call newton, then which bucket will we see into? That would be a problem, right?

# Data Types
There can be different types of variables. There can be numbers that we need to store, or there can be words and sentences, right? So we need to declare the `type` of the `data` that each `variable` will store.

Also, recall that computers store everything in 0s and 1s, I mean in binary (it's strongly recommended that if you don't know about the binary number system, then check out the last class).

Some maths:
- Each digit of a binary number is called `bit`.
- `1 byte = 8 bits`
- How many unsigned (non-negative) numbers can we store in the decimal system using 2 digits? What about 4 digits? 9 digits?
- Similarly, how many unsigned (non-negative) numbers can we store in the binary system using 2 digits/bits? What about 4 bits? 9 bits?
- How many signed (non-negative and negative) numbers can we store in the decimal system using 2 digits? What about 4 digits? 9 digits?
- How many signed (non-negative and negative) numbers can we store in the binary system using 2 bits? What about 4 bits? 9 bits? Oops, how can we store negative numbers using just 0s and 1s? Hmmzzzz. Why not make the leftmost bit a flag? I mean what about when the leftmost bit is 0, the number is positive and when the leftmost bit is 1, the number is negative? Sounds elegant! So computers use something called [two's complement](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z6qqmsg/revision/5) to represent negative numbers.

 ![logo](https://i.ibb.co/gzNDxVN/image.png)
 
 Here, Denary means Decimal. So we can see that we can store numbers from -2<sup>3</sup> to 2<sup>3</sup> - 1 using 4-bit `signed` numbers.

# Representing Numbers and More to Variables
Numbers can be of different types! They can be [integers](https://www.mathsisfun.com/whole-numbers.html) or [real](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/real-numbers.html) numbers.

## int
`int` data type is used to represent `integer` numbers. `int` has a space/size of `4 bytes = 32 bits`. So which numbers can be stored in an `int` variable?
- ```bash
  int a;
  a = 6;
  ```
  - `int a;`: It means we have declared the variable `a` as `int`. That means `a` can store any `signed integers` which can be stored using 
    32 bits.
  - `a = 6;`: It means we have assigned the number 6 to `a`.
- ```bash
  int age = 20;
  ```
  It is similar. Here, we have declared the variable `age` using the datatype `int` as well as assigned 20 to the variable in the same statement.
  
  ![logo](https://i.ibb.co/cxCyqMd/image.png)
  
- ```bash
  int a, b = 3, c = 4;
  ```
  So we can declare multiple variables in the same line. Here, we didn't assign anything to `a`, assigned 3 to `b`, and assigned 4 to `c`.
- ```bash
  int a; int b = 3;
  ```
  We can write two statements in the same line! No problem.

**Things to Notice:**
- Each statement ends with a `;` in C++. It is needed to act as a `wall` or `separator` between two consecutive statements. Makes sense?
- The variable names can be `a` or `newton` or any word in general. There are many rules for variable naming though: [check this out](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/variables-literals#:~:text=Rules%20for%20naming%20a%20variable). For example:
  - A variable name can only have alphabets, numbers, and the underscore `_`.
  - A variable name cannot begin with a number.
  - A variable name cannot be a [keyword](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/keywords-identifiers)/reserved word.
  - Variable names are case sensitive. So `newton`, `Newton` and `neWtOn` are all different variables.
- It is better to give meaningful variable names. For example `total_sum` is a better name than `ts`. It makes the code more readable.

## unsigned int
`unsigned int` is used to represent unsigned integers. It also has a space/size of `4 bytes = 32 bits`. So which numbers can be stored in an `unsigned int` variable?

Will the following code store âˆ’6 in `a`?
```bash
  unsigned int a;
  a = -6;
```
<details><summary>Check Solution</summary>
No! Because -6 is not unsigned.</details>

# Basic Output
In C++, `cout` sends formatted output to standard output devices, such as the screen. We use `cout` along with the `<<` operator for displaying output.
 
For example, `cout << 10`; will print `10`.

# But How Does A Program Really Works
Let's just dive into it. Shall we?
Consider the following code:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  a = 10;
  b = 20;
  int sum;
  sum = a + b;
  cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```
What's happening?
- `#include <iostream>` is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as `cout`. Header files mainly add functionality to C++ programs. If you want to use certain predefined functions, then you have to include the header file for that function. In this case, `cout` prints to the screen, which the compiler knows by the header file `iostream` that we have included.
- `using namespace std;` means that we can use different stuff from the standard library. For example, `cout` is from the standard library, so we should use `using namespace std;` as we have used `cout` in our code.
- Don't worry about these 2 lines, we will learn about them later (as they are harder to learn), just understand that we will almost always use these lines in our C++ programs.
- Next, we have a blank line. C++ ignores white space (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc). But we use it to make the code more readable.
- Another thing that ALWAYS appears in a C++ program, is `int main()`. This is called a `function` (we will learn about functions later). Any code inside its curly brackets `{}` will be executed.
- `int a, b;` declares two `variables` named `a` and `b` where both of them have `int` datatype.
- `a = 10;` assigns 10 to the variable `a`.
- `b = 20;` assigns 20 to the variable `b`.
- `int sum;` declares the `variable` named `sum` which has `int` datatype.
- `sum = a + b;` assigns the sum of the numbers stored in the variables `a` and `b` to the variable `sum`. So that means `sum` will be assigned `10 + 20 = 30`.
- `cout << sum;` prints the number stored in the variable `sum`. So it will print `30` if you run the code!
- `return 0;` ends the main function. You should always use it at the end to return from the main function. Anything after that won't be executed. We will learn about `return` in the upcoming classes.
- Don't forget to add the closing curly bracket `}` to complete the main function.

In general, the compiler compiles the code to a machine/object code and it gets executed and the output gets shown in your terminal/screen.

# Data Types Continued
## Representing Numbers Continued
### long long int
`long long int`/`long long` is used to represent signed long long integers. It has a size of `8 bytes = 64 bits`. So which numbers can be stored in a `long long int` variable?

To feel, `int` can store integers upto `2^31-1 = 2147483647` which is around 2.10<sup>9</sup> and `long long` can store integers upto `2^63-1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807` which is around 9.10<sup>18</sup>.

```bash
long long int a = 100;
```

### unsigned long long int
`unsigned long long int`/`unsigned long long` is used to represent unsigned long long integers. It has a size of `8 bytes = 64 bits`. So which numbers can be stored in an `unsigned long long int` variable?

Will the following code store âˆ’100 in a?
```bash
unsigned long long int a = -100;
```
<details><summary>Check Solution</summary>
No! Because -100 is not unsigned.
</details>

### float
`float` is used to represent real numbers. It has a size of `4 bytes = 32 bits`. Notice that this doesn't mean that this will store the same numbers as `int` because we now also have to represent the digits after the floating point using these 32 bits. We will learn more about floats in the future.
```bash
float a = 12.69;
float b = 3;
```
### double
`double` is also used to represent real numbers. It has a size of `8 bytes = 64 bits`. Notice that this doesn't mean that this will store the same numbers as `long long int` because we now also have to represent the digits after the floating point using these 64 bits. We will learn more about doubles in the future.
```bash
double a = 12.69;
double b = 3;
```
**Things to Notice:** `double` can be used to represent larger numbers. **So it is better to use `double` to store real numbers** because it will have better `precision` (that is it can store more digits after the floating-point). We will learn about it later.

## Representing Characters
So there are not that many characters in English Alphabet. There are `26` lowercase characters and `26` uppercase characters. Also, there are special characters like `'?'`, `'-'` etc, and also single digit characters like `'0'` for 0 to `'9'` for 9 (not `'12'` as it has two characters at once).

So what we can do is we can map each of the characters to some integer! Brilliant, right? For example, `'a'` is mapped to the number `97`. So when the compiler sees the character `'a'`, it acts like it has seen `97`!

It turned out that we don't need more than 255 characters. So how many bits are enough to store numbers from 0 to 255?

Yes, 8 bits are enough.

`char` is used to represent characters. It has a size of `1 byte = 8 bits`. Characters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes `' '`.
```bash
char letter = 'a';
```
So what is happening in the first line? The compiler is mapping `97` (using binary, of course) to the variable `letter`.

You may ask why `'a'` is mapped to `97` but not `0`? Great question! So there is a standard for this mapping, and it is called `ASCII` (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) Code. Learn more about it here: [smash me](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.htm).

Just for an idea:
- `'a'` mapped to `97`, `'b'` mapped to `98`, `'c'` mapped to `99`, ..., `'z'` mapped to `122`.
- `'A'` mapped to `65`, `'B'` mapped to `66`, `'C'` mapped to `67`, ..., `'Z'` mapped to `90`.
- the digit character `'0'` mapped to `48`, `'1'` mapped to `49`, `'2'` mapped to `50`, ..., `'9'` mapped to `57`.
- the newline character is `'\n'` and space is `' '`.

Run the following code by pasting it in the `main` function.
```bash
char letter = 'a';
cout << letter;
cout << '\n';
cout << 'A';
cout << ' ';
cout << '0';
```
## Representing Words
To represent words, we need lots of characters, right? So we will learn how to represent a word (or `string` if you speak in programming languages) in the next class.

For now, just know that we can print a string using double quotes `" "`.

Example 1:
```bash
cout << "Hello World";
```
Example 2:
```bash
cout << "Hello World";
cout << "Hello World\n";
```
## bool
There is another datatype named `bool` which can only have two possible values: `true` or `false`. So it has a size of `1 bit` only.
```bash
bool okay = false; // means i am not okay :((
bool sad = true;
```
# endl
There is another way of printing newline and that is `endl`.
```bash
cout << 10 << '\n';
cout << 20 << endl;
cout << 30 << endl;
```
# Comments
C++ comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. C++ compilers completely ignore them.

You can use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multiple-line comments.

```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // declaring the variable x
  int x;
  x = 10; // assigning 10 to x
  /*
  we can now print
  the value of x
  */
  cout << x;
  return 0;
}
```
# Basic Output Continued
Note that you can print multiple stuff in the same line:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 10, b = 20;
  cout << a << ' ' << b << ' ' << 30 << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
# Basic Input
In C++, `cin` takes formatted input from standard input devices such as the keyboard. We use the `cin` along with the `>>` operator for taking input.
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "I can guess your age! Just enter your age: ";
  int age;
  cin >> age; // taking input
  cout << "Voila! Your age is: " << age;
  return 0;
}
```
Similar code:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int age;
  cin >> age; // taking input
  cout << age;
  return 0;
}
```
Similar code:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a;
  cin >> a; // taking input
  cout << a << endl;
  int b;
  cin >> b; // taking input
  cout << b << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note that you can take multiple inputs in the same line:

```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  int c;
  /*
  taking three integers as input:
  - the first integer will be in a
  - the second integer will be in b
  - the third integer will be in c
  */
  cin >> a >> b >> c; 
  cout << a << ' ' << b << ' ' << c << '\n';
  cout << "Sum of a + b + c = " << a + b + c << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
# Garbage Value
Consider this example:
```bash
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a;
  int b = 3;
  cout << a + b << '\n'; // what is the value of a?
  return 0;
}
```
`int a;`: It means we have declared the variable `a` as `int`. Note that right at this moment, `a` does not necessarily have 0 in its store. It can have anything as we haven't initialized anything to this variable. So if you print this number it can print any random number which is called `garbage value`. Some computers will store 0 and some will not, so nevereveruseanyuninitializedvariableinanequation.

This code will not print 3 on most of the computers. It will print some random number as we have used an uninitialized variable in the equation.

# Swapping Numbers
Take two integer variables `a` and `b` as input. You need to swap them. So after the swap, `a` should be equal to the value of `b` and `b` should be equal to the value of `a`. Finally, print the values of `a` and `b`.

  b = a; // assigning the value of a to b
  a = temp; // assigning the value of temp to a. And as temp = b, so a will also be equal to b
  cout << a << ' ' << b << endl; // printing variables
  return 0;

# Problem: Swap er Baap
Take three integers `a`, `b` and `c` as input. Then do some swaps in such a way that,

- the value of `c` becomes the value of `a`
