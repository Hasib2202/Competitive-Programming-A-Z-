# i++ vs ++i
'i++' means 'post-increment,' because it increases the value of i by one after the operation is completed.
`++i` is `pre-increment` because it increases the value of i by one before performing the operation.

```bash
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int i, j;
  i = 1;
  j = i++;
  cout << i << ' ' << j << '\n';

  i = 1;
  j = ++i;
  cout << i << ' ' << j << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
