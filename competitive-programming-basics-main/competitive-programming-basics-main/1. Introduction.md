# A typical C++ code template for competitive programming looks like this:

```bash
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // write code here
}
```

# If you don't have a Laptop?
Install Cxxdroid on your smartphone: [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.cxxdroid&hl=en&gl=US). You can use this app to run C and C++ files.

# Why C++?
C++ is a good choice for competitive programming because it has many features that make the code more efficient and stable.
